      p.title About the Project
      p Devoted is a temple app that allows devotee to find nearby temples, learn more about that temple, interact with them give reviews about their experience. Devotees can also become a temple member or a pujari for the temple and people who would like to participate in the day to day activities of the temple can become volunteer. 
      p This app helps users to learn three different aspects i.e Spirituality, Religious and wellness. As of now we would be focusing on the religious part.

      p.title My Role
      p BI designed this app from the ground up. Working closely with Sridhar (CEO of Virility Solutions Pvt Ltd) to achieve our goals. 
      p Designing this app was a huge challenge due to the time constraints and business objectives. We had a discussion regarding the way we are going to introduce this app in the market. I.e the Platform in which we are going to release the app - Android, iOS or Web. By conducting a thorough brainstorming, we came up with a pretty clear cut numbers in terms of users using a particular platform. 
      p According the stats, we decided to work on the Android app. Our goal was to focus on the overall experience of the user, in this case, the devotees. Since there wasn’t any clear data available on this type of apps, I had to rely on Sridhar to navigate me through the different aspects of the app.

          p.title The Challenge

      p.title Understand the Problem and Creating Persona
      p According to Wikipedia, there are 78.9 percent of Indians who follow Hinduism in India. Due to which there are more than 400,000 temples and twice the number of Temple members who take part in the day to day activities in worshipping gods. So we decided to concentrate on one religion first and then add other religions to our app.

      p We also found that people when they visit temple they wear clothes which are usually orange, yellow or white in color. This color combination gave me the idea to choose Orange like gradient as a Primary color combination.

      p.sub-title Characters and their pain points:


      p Ramesh is 48 years old, he is a very religious man takes part in the daily activities held at his local temple. He want to be connected to the temple members so that he doesn’t miss any of the programmes. He uses few bhajan apps.


      p Venu Gopal is 18 years old, his father is a pujari at the temple. He also wants to be a pujari one day, so he assists his father in every way possible in the puja and yajna that happens in the temple. He also conducts festivals inside the temple but doesn’t have any efficient way to call his friends and loved once to the festival. As of now he uses apps like facebook and whatsapp to get connected.

          p.title Takeaway
          p All in all, it was a good experience working together on this project. Devotee is not only a good solution to the religious aspect of life but also it has smoothly coupled with spirituality and wellness. 

          p As of now this app is at its basic stage. I believe that this app has a good potential in capturing the market compared to other competitors. In future, It may also include store kinda feature where you can buy and sell products that helps you to be spiritual or being healthy. 

          p By using this app anyone would be able to quickly navigate to a nearby temple, chat with temple members, participate in the cultural events conducted by the temple organizations. This will reduce the effort or time to minimum.
