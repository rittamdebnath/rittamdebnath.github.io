          <p class="title">The Challenge</p>
          <p>Here the challenge was to integrate traditional job listing with the learning part and the career growth options so that users can choose which career path to take and what to do to achieve it. </p>

      <div class="img-block"><img src="assets/img/jobstar/problem.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/></div>
      <p class="title">Understanding the Users</p>
      <p class="sub-title">Conducted user research</p>
      <p>Before I started this project, I had already selected my target audience. I called few of my friends and asked them to validate my idea. Interviewed few of them and asked them what are the types of apps that they use, what are the pain points that they are experiencing.</p>
      <p>3 Interviewees were actively looking for jobs and 2 were working professionals.</p>
      <p>According to the research, I’ve found that freshers have a problem where they don’t know what career path to choose and there is no one to guide them. On the other hand professionals want to update their skills daily via online materials so that they can get better opportunities. </p><strong>Why are you using a job app ?</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>To get better offers</li>
        <li>To learn what are the jobs there are in the market that suits my profile.</li>
        <li>To get feedback on my portfolio from the recruiters like linkedin etc</li>
      </ul><strong>Pain points with the existing products?</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Too many steps to apply for a simple job</li>
        <li>Not clear about the job description and the requirement</li>
        <li>Lack of relation between learning and getting hired.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="sub-title">Made Assumptions</p>
      <p>These four quadrants captures the target audience and context of the product, it includes: User needs, User goals, Constraints, Assumptions</p>
      <p>Users want an app that assists them in the right career path so that they can apply for the right job and the jobs that they are interested in. </p>
