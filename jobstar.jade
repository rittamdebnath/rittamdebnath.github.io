      p.title Understanding the Users

      p.sub-title Conducted user research

      p Before I started this project, I had already selected my target audience. I called few of my friends and asked them to validate my idea. Interviewed few of them and asked them what are the types of apps that they use, what are the pain points that they are experiencing.

      p 3 Interviewees were actively looking for jobs and 2 were working professionals.
      
      p According to the research, I’ve found that freshers have a problem where they don’t know what career path to choose and there is no one to guide them. On the other hand professionals want to update their skills daily via online materials so that they can get better opportunities. 

      strong Why are you using a job app ?
      ul
        li To get better offers
        li To learn what are the jobs there are in the market that suits my profile.
        li To get feedback on my portfolio from the recruiters like linkedin etc
        
      strong Pain points with the existing products?
      ul
        li Too many steps to apply for a simple job
        li Not clear about the job description and the requirement
        li Lack of relation between learning and getting hired.
